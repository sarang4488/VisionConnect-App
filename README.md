<b>Vision Connect</b> - Voice based assistant for visually challenged people  - APPROVED
comment: integrate with google home 

As a part of our project, we went to the Non-Profit organization California based NGO and interviewed with CEO of NGO, John Christian.
We have tested our application there with bunch of people and took feedback and undertood the real problem they are facing. We got the  offer also to work with them in near future to help this community. 

Here is the Youtube link of the detailed interview and the day we took feedback from NGO : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4ZJ8EfU6Wo&t=7s


This project aims to help the visually impaired people to be a part of growing world by using internet and also aims to make life of such people quite easy. 
We are planning to make the application for them where use of the keyboard is completely eliminated, and the user will interact with the system using only his/her voice. The system will take the user action based on the user voice.
This will initiate a process in the system and the action will be performed with the confirmation shown on the user end.
We have used Natural Language Processing using DialogFlow. Also, we will be integrating it with Google Home to make it more accessible to the visually impaired people.
We have made the application such that any person (visually impaired, elderly people or any other person) can use it easily.
